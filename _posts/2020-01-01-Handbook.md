Handbook of Communication Science 17. Boston/Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.

> This handbook embraces the multitude of meanings and  hence  addresses  many  diverse  communicative  acts  that  entail  a  relationship  to  scientific knowledge or work, stemming from institutions or individuals, addressing both scientists or the public, intending to inform, influence, enlighten, argue or oth-erwise negotiate about science. In these and many other aspects, the handbook takes a broad perspective: It looks at communicating individuals and institutions; it starts off from a broad notion of “science” – not excluding any scientific subject –, and it adopts  an  inter-  or  multidisciplinary  approach  to  the  field. (p. XI)
